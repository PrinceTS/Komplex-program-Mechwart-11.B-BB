<p>What is the BIOS? It is the accronym of “Binary Input Output System”, a software that is installed by default in the motherboard of a PC (there are also those who identify it as the chip that hosts it, due to its firmware nature) and whose function is allowing the computer to boot, before the operating system starts working.

    The BIOS is hosted inside an integrated circuit and is supported by another chip called CMOS, which acts as a kind of memory that is used by the BIOS. What the BIOS does is, basically, executing a series of routines that enable verifying the state of the computer and its startup.
    Thus, right after the computer has been booted, the BIOS is responsible for starting, configuring and testing the hardware of the computer, to subsequently start the boot manager that will allow the startup of the operating system.
    Its function, therefore, is twofold: on the one hand, it boots and verifies the state of the hardware and on the other hand, it works as a kind of “bridge” that allows the hardware and the operating system to begin to “understand each other”.
    What are the four main functions of a PC BIOS?
    POST - Test the computer hardware and make sure no errors exist before loading the operating system. Additional information on the POST is available on our POST and beep codes page.
    Bootstrap Loader - Locate the operating system. If a capable operating system is located, the BIOS will pass control to it.
    BIOS drivers - Low-level drivers that give the computer basic operational control over your computer's hardware.
    BIOS setup or CMOS setup - Configuration program that allows you to configure hardware settings including system settings, such as computer passwords, time, and date.
    Up to now, we could suppose that, although its function is very important, the BIOS could go more or less unnoticed. What happens is that, sometimes, we are very aware that the BIOS is there, fulfilling its function, and it is usually at the worst moments: when problems arise.
    
    Indeed, if while carrying out any of its tasks, the BIOS detects any error, it will not allow the system to continue booting until the failure is solved. Sometimes, it could even get to the point of warning us about something that does not work properly through its famous and shrill beeps, which might be different depending on the type of error found.
    This is the cumbersome moment that we have all experienced at some point, when the BIOS tells us something is wrong and we are forced to get into its menus to fix the problem (if we are able to do so).
    
    However, the BIOS is not only available when things go wrong. Even if there are no issues, we can always access the BIOS menus to make changes to the configuration of the computer (something that is only advisable to carry out if we really know what we are doing).
    
    What happens with the BIOS is that, although it has been doing its job well for decades, times change, and from time to time younger creations that surpass the old ones are born. And that leads us to UEFI.</p>
